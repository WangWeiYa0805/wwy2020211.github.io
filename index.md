## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

Hello!This is my code diary.With a relatively solid professional knowledge in mathematical physics and coding . I previously majored in Artificial Intelligence. Recently,my research turns to the In Memory Computing . I learn relative knowledge by myself and try to realize some simple function(such as accelerate the computation), I have strong aspiration to develop in this field.Sometimes I will upload some simple example about engineering in my major field or something amateur.
