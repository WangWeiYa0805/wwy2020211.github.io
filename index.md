## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

Hello!This is my code diary.With a relatively solid professional knowledge in mathematical physics and coding . Recently,my interest turns to the computer structure and system. I learn relative knowledge by myself and try to realize some simple function(such as accelerate the computation), I have strong aspiration to develop in this field.Sometimes I will upload some simple example about engineering in my major field or something amateur.
